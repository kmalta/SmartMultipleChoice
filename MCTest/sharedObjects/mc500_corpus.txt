 He told kids what to do what to play what to sing and called them names like Dork
 He always had a smile on his face as he sat on the bench next to the big tree and watched his kingdom
 All of the other kids were scared of him
 Even I was scared of him
 He was mean and he could beat you up if you made him angry

It was the Fourth of July and Frank the cowboy had a meal planned
 He was going to cook for the whole town and do it in a bear costume which was what they did in his part of the nation to celebrate the holiday and was not weird at all
 

Unfortunately Frank had mistaken powdered soap for sugar because the eye holes in his bear costume didn't quite match up with his own eyes
 He put the whole box of soap in the strawberry punch that he meant to give to his party guests


Try the punch Frank said
 
Since they didn't want to be mean after all Frank went through a lot of trouble in order to respect the town's bear costume wearing ways the whole town drank the gross drink
 No one got sick but they were all pretty grossed out and after talking to each other planned to help Frank make the meal next year to keep it from happening again

What flavor was the punch meant to be
What did Frank put in the punch and what did he mean to put in the punch

Thank you so much

There once was a pumpkin
  The pumpkin was sad
   The pumpkin wanted to leave the garden and see the world
  But the pumpkin had to stay in the garden because its vine held it there
  One day a fox came by
  The pumpkin asked the fox to cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden
  The fox said it would cut the vine so the pumpkin could leave the garden
  When the fox cut the vine the pumpkin could roll around
  The pumpkin rolled around until it got out of the garden
  First it met a cat
  It told the cat it was happy because now it could see the world

Every day at noon when it was time for recess Mrs
 Snooter would honk a loud horn
 This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime


The students in Mrs
 Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside
 As soon as the doors opened the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground
 However it was not an easy race
 There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed and Mrs
 Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race


First the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox
 This may sound simple but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox
 If students jumped over the holes they might have sand thrown in their eyes


If a student could pass the sandbox test the next problem was the jungle gym
 The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs
 Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym
 They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym
 It was difficult but some students in Mrs
 Snooter's class would make it past


Finally there was a long run to the seesaw
 Only a few students would still be racing at this point and they would run as fast as they could
 Every day there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students
 Most of the time he was the winner of the race and would play on the seesaw with his friends

Which of the following grades did not share recess with Mrs Snooter's class
What grade did Mrs Snooter teach
Which of the following things could happen to the students at recess
What was the first thing the class had to pass

There was once a pig named Oink who lived on a farm but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes
 In his free time he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly
 He would look up at the stars in wonder hoping that some day his dream might come true
 For many years his life carried on this way
 He would wake up on the farm go to work and then come home to dream about flying
 That is until one day he got a letter with a strange sticker on it that was shaped like a star
 He opened the letter in excitement wondering what it said
 The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds
 Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly
 If he chose to go to the party he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals
 Oink was so happy he barely knew how to react
 He accepted the invitation and two days later got a package containing his wings
 Oink's dream was finally coming true
 He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky where the party was being held
 Once he arrived he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also
 He saw horses dogs cats and plenty of birds

 Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends

A tiger named Timmy and Bear named Buster were going for a walk in the park by the river and were going to go swim later

 Timmy called Buster over to come talk to the hamster and see if there was anything they could do to help

 They found out his name was Henry
 Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it
 Luckily for Henry Busters mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years Buster knew how to set a broken bone and fix it

Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and I don't know what to get him
 He's eleven years old like me and to be honest everyone likes to always mix us up
 It's not that we look alike or sound alike or even dress alike but it's our names Tim and Tom that do it
 Anyways he likes dinosaurs board games and toy cars so I'm not sure if anything under ten dollars has both of those in it
 He also told me not to get anything that has feathers included in it as his mom always gets headaches when she's around them


My mom took me to the store and I looked around for something Tom would like
 We had to pass through the clothing medicine and jewelry sections before we got to the toy aisle
 My mom told me to not let her forget that we need to go to the garden section to get a new sprinkler before we go but I was too into the toys to understand her
 Finally I found a board game where you play as different cars to try and finish a race first and thought that was perfect even without the dinosaurs
 From there we checked out and I gave the present to Tom on his birthday
 He loved it and we played with our other friends Daryl John and Angie
 Sadly our other friend James couldn't make it as he was sick but we still had so much fun together

How are Tim and Tom mixed up by others
What did Tom warn Tim not to get when it comes to gifts
Which of the following sections did Tim and his mom not go through to get to the toy aisle

Jamey really wanted a pet dog so he went to ask his parents


Mom Dad can I we get a dog


Jamey's mom and dad thought about this and then answered him
 

Having a pet can be a lot of work Jamey
 When you own a dog you have to feed him and take him for walks and clean up after him
 You even have to do those things when you would rather be playing or watching TV
 If you promise to help take care of him we'll get a dog


Jamey was very happy to hear this
 The next weekend his mom and dad took him to a big building where puppies and kittens without homes were kept
 It was very noisy inside
 Jamey looked at a big yellow dog first
 

This dog is pretty big Jamey his father said
 He might need a bigger yard to run around in than we have
  

Jamey thought that Dad was right about that
 The next dog Jamey looked at was a very small white dog
 It barked over and over again as Jamey and his mother looked at it


This dog is very noisy Jamey
 He might need a lot of attention from you
 Do you think you want to give this puppy that much attention


Jamey wasn't sure he could give the little white dog all the time it needed to be happy
 Finally Jamey looked at a third dog a brown dog that was bigger than the white dog but smaller than the yellow one
 The dog came over to Jamey right away and seemed to love to be petted and fussed over


Do you like the brown dog
 asked Jamey's dad


Yes
 said Jamey
 Can we get him


Will you feed him and walk him every afternoon when you get home from school
 asked Jamey's mom


I promise said Jamey


In that case I guess we have a dog


This made Jamey very happy

How many pets did Jamey look at before picking one
What did Jamey have to promise his parents so he could get a dog
Why did Jamey not choose the yellow dog

Jake and Carol live next door to a banana farm
 One day as they were taking a walk Jake asked Carol if she could smell the sweet bananas
 Carol said yes and that she would love it if the farmer would give them some
 Jake's mouth watered at the thought of eating the golden yellow bananas
 They then began walking to the farmer's barn to ask him if they could have some
 When they arrived they saw a sign that said the farmer would be out until tomorrow night
 He was also a singer and would be performing at a school two towns over in Orangeville
 Instead of waiting for the farmer to return so that they could ask for some bananas Jake and Carol began walking around the farm to pick their own
 

As he was walking Jake tripped on a rock
 As he tried to stand back up he felt a sharp pain in his leg
 He could walk but it was very painful
 Carol let Jake lean on her as they walked home
 They knew it was a bad idea to go on the farmer's land without his permission and would never do it again

What was the farmer out doing
Where do Carol and Jake live
Why did Jake lean on Carol
What happened to Jake's leg

Carefully Kerry followed the frog as it jumped across the grass

 He wanted to help the frog


He ran inside and got a plastic pail that he used to use at the beach for sand
 He filled it up with water and brought it to the backyard


It took him some time to find the frog again
 It seemed to be moving slower than it had before

 He watched the frog swim around for a bit and then carried the pail around to the front of the house


It was a short way to a nearby creek running through his neighborhood

 Everyone calls him the Zoo King
 That means Mom is the Zoo Queen
 And that means that I'm the Zoo Prince
 Being a prince is very special


I spend every morning walking around to see the zoo
 It's better than any animal book
 I say hello to the lions
 I say woof at all of the wolves
 I make faces to the penguins
 Once I even gave a morning kiss to a bear
 My favorite animal is the piggy
 I named him Samson
 He likes to eat mustard so I toss some mustard jars into his cage every morning
 I don't know why that piggy likes mustard so much


Sometimes I walk around with the Zoo King and Zoo Queen
 Then we say hello to the animals together
 I really like those days
 Everybody who works at the Zoo says hello to us when we walk by
 At lunchtime we all go to the Zoo restaurant and eat pork chops
 I hope Samson doesn't get mad about that

Once upon a time there was a blue spider named Twinkle Toes
 All spiders have to get rid of their old skin in order to grow a new larger skin
 Twinkle Toes was a very special kind of spider because his tenth new skin would be pink instead of blue
 When it was time for Twinkle Toes to turn pink he was very excited but he was also worried
 He was afraid that his best friend an orange cat named Morty Roo wouldn't know that the pink spider was Twinkle Toes in his new skin
 He was scared that Morty Roo would mistake him for a normal spider who does not change colors
 If Morty Roo saw a spider who wasn't Twinkle Toes he would likely kill the spider and eat it
 Twinkle Toes was hoping to tell Morty Roo that he would soon turn pink but Morty Roo didn't come around to visit that day
 Twinkle Toes called over Woofington the neighbor's dog
  Twinkle Toes asked Woofington to please tell Morty Roo that he would be pink after he grew his new skin but would still be the same Twinkle Toes he had always been
  Woofington normally liked to chase Morty Roo around the neighborhood
 He knew he would have to be nice to Morty Roo to deliver the message and that it would be really hard
 Because it was so important to Twinkle Toes Woofington said he would deliver the message
 Woofington had a special respect for spiders because they eat other bugs
 Woofington is afraid of other bugs because they could bite him and make him sick
 That evening Twinkle Toes began growing his new pink skin and Woofington explained to Morty Roo that he shouldn't eat the pink spider because it was still his old friend

Max is a very happy cow
 He's dark brown with big blue eyes and a soft pink nose
  He lives in a huge field during the summer with beautiful and tasty buttercups and hay
  During the winter he lives in a nice warm barn
 

The hay isn't as tasty then but it keeps him fed until summer comes back
  One winter day Max wanted to see what was happening outside when it turned cold and bright
 He had never gone out during the winter because the Farmer always locked the barn door behind him
 But today the door was wide open and Max could see the sunshine reflecting off the bright ground
 He had to know why
 So Max pushed open the gate to his little house with his nose and walked over to the door
 Max was surprised and confused by the ground outside it was so white and sparkly
 His breath started fogging in the air and the ground was cold and crunchy
 What is this
 He asked the rooster sitting on the fence
 The roosters name was Omaha and he was all white except for a big red puff on his head
  

It's snow son
 Did you grow up in a barn

 The rooster laughed and flew away towards his little rooster house
 

It's so pretty
 Max said
 He pushed it with his nose
 Oh
 It's so chilly
 He started to take a bite of the crunchy white bits
 He wanted to see if they had a good taste when he heard the farmer
 

Max
 What are you doing out here
 The farmer named Bob asked
 He was loud but not mad
 It's much too cold for a small cow like you we better get you back inside
 He pushed Max inside the barn and this time locked the barn door tight

What did Max think of the snow
What was the cow's name
Who told Max that it was snow
Why did Max leave the barn
Johnny walked toward the time machine
 His adult neighbor the scientist had asked him to watch it for him for the weekend
 He had also asked Johnny not to touch it
 But it was a time machine
 Johnny had to see it


The machine was big and silver and shiny and looked like an ice cream cone that had been dropped
 It had a square hole as tall as Johnny and it hummed like a fridge


Johnny took a deep breath and stepped inside
 Just a peek he thought


There were three buttons inside
 One said past and one said present
 Another said space


Johnny looked at the buttons
 He looked at the buttons some more
 He waited and without thinking his arm jumped out in front of him
 He pushed the button that said past


There was a bright light
 And bam


Johnny stepped out of the machine
 It was raining and there were many strange looking trees
 The air was warm
 The dirt below was muddy


He took a deep breath
 So this is the past Johnny said


Just then he heard a bump
 And another one
 The ground shook
 The bumps got louder and the ground shook harder
 A tree fell


Johnny heard a roar


Two more trees fell


Suddenly Johnny saw it A Tyrannosaurus Rex


Johnny was so scared he couldn't breathe


The T
 Rex looked up and left and right
 He sniffed the air and leaned down
 He didn't seem to see Johnny


Then Johnny sneezed
 And the T
 Rex started walking towards him
 Faster and faster
 Bump
 Bump bump
 Bumpbumpbumpbump until he was running


Johnny jumped back into the time machine and pressed present


There was a bright light and Johnny was back home


He took a deep breath
 He was home


Phew he said


Next time he would listen to his adult neighbor he thought

What kind of dinosaur did Johnny meet
What button did Johnny push
What did the time machine look like
What did the three buttons say
As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow
 He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal the lion
 Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it
 He watched the football sail toward the tire right as his mom called him in for dinner
 His mom had made his favorite food hotdogs
 He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog
 His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn carrots and drink all of his milk too
 

That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too
 Michael wondered if his best friends Joe Nick and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day
 He closed his eyes and went to sleep

 I am going to wait here for you until you get back

 Twinkles flew off to find her best friend


Soon she heard a voice calling from down below
 Help me
 I'm stuck

 Sure enough it was Betsy
 She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave
 

Don't worry I am coming to save you
 cried Twinkles
 Twinkles swooped down to the ground
 She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud

Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud

He checked his pockets
 They were empty
 Where did his money go
 This was a problem
 In order to get a soda and snack he would need money
 

Sam ran home as fast as he could
 He was in a rush
 He passed by Jim as he was running
 He asked Sam why he was running
 No time Sam Said
 

When he got inside the house Sam was very happy
 His money was on his dresser in his bedroom
 Thank goodness
 He had enough money to get a soda
 Sam ran back outside but this time he slowed down when he saw Jim
 He told Jim to come with him to Mr
 Brown's table
 He had enough money to buy them both a soda

It was Saturday and it was nice outside
 I did not have school and my mom did not have work
 When I woke up we ate breakfast and got ready for the day
 My mom started to clean up the house so I went up to my room to play with my toys
 My mom came upstairs and told me If you clean up your room there is a great surprise in it for you
 I was very excited about what the surprise was but not very excited to clean my room
 My mom left and closed the door
 I looked around and saw how messy my room was
 And I really did not want to clean it
 So what I did was pick up all my stuff in my room and put it all in my closet
 It did not take me very long so I hung out in my room for a little bit longer before heading downstairs to the basement to tell my mom I was ready for my surprise
 She came upstairs to see how I did and immediately saw what I did
 She was not happy about it
 She said You either do it right or Ill do it right and you won't get a surprise
 That was enough to make me clean my room right
 Finally my mom told me the surprise when I was all finished
 She told me we were going out to the park
 But by the time we got there I could only play for a little bit before it started getting dark
 I wished I would have cleaned my room right the first time so I had more time at the park

why was his mom upset
what was the surprise
where did he put his toys the first time
where was his room

  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside
  After that my mom came out with my cake
  It was chocolate with chocolate icing
  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too
 We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could
 I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool but it was too cold
  My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick
  It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about

 He drove his blue truck to the store
 On the way he passed a green car a red van and a yellow bus
 When he got to the store he met his friends Bob & Mark
 He asked if they had seen his friend Joe but they said no
 At the store Jim bought two pieces of chicken tomato sauce cheese and bread
 He drove back to the house but he saw that something was missing
 He had forgotten to grab the bag with the bread in it
 He drove back to the store apologized to the clerk and grabbed his bag with the bread inside
 When he got home he began to get the food ready

 After that it took him another hour to cook the food
 He had to wait another hour after it was done cooking for his dinner guests to arrive

One beautiful day there was a watermelon
  This watermelon was sitting on a bench
  The bench was on the grass
  The grass was in the park
  

It was a beautiful place
  But Watermelon had a problem
  It was bored
  All of its friends were busy


I'm so bored
 cried Watermelon


Come talk to me
 answered a voice from the park


But who are you
  Where are you
 asked the watermelon


I am a rock
  I am behind you


Watermelon turned around
  Off in the distance it saw the rock


But Rock you are so far away
  Can you come closer


No I can't
  I am a rock
  I am big and flat and heavy
  I am not round like you
  I can't roll to join my friends
  I can't play with everyone like you can
  My shape is no good
  No good at all
  But I want to play
  I want to talk


That is a very sad story Rock
  But what can I do


Can you roll


Well yes yes I can


Then roll over here


And so Watermelon did
  They talked for a long time
  They sang songs
  They played games
  It was so much fun that Watermelon did not see the weather was changing
  Suddenly a strong wind blew and it pushed Watermelon away


Help
  Help
  I am rolling away help


Quick Watermelon
  Get behind me
  Rock was afraid for his new friend


Watermelon rolled behind Rock and there it was protected by Rock from the dangerous wind


You saved me
  Thank you

No problem


You may be big and flat and heavy
  And maybe you can't roll around like me
  But I am very happy because of that
  I am safe because you are what you are

I'd had the piggy bank for a long time
 So long in fact that I don't really remember getting it
 My aunt once told me a whole story about it in which it was passed down through the family for many many years only to come to me
 I was pretty little at the time so I believed her with no question
 It made me think that the bank was important
 It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness
 I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up to be spent on some sort of treasure
 And then when I was fifteen I broke it


I didn't mean to
 I was cleaning my room in a hurry so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house
 I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly knocking the pig's shelf and down it went
 About a thousand pieces and way fewer coins than I would have believed flew everywhere
 I started to cry



My mother came in at the sound of the crash
 
I'm so so sorry
 I cried
 I broke the bank
 I broke the family bank

What Sarah
 my mother asked kneeling next to me on the floor
 The what

The bank
 Aunt Tracy said it was in the family for years

What this

 It was fifty cents

 His older sister Sandy was visiting her best friend
 His younger sister Sarah was going to a movie with their mom
 So today was a special day only Kyle and Dad being guys together


Once they reached the store Kyle walked slowly down each aisle looking at all the toys and trying to find the best one
 Purple superheroes colorful games and a bright blue ball all caught his eye but Kyle kept looking
 Finally he saw it hiding on the bottom shelf
 The most perfect toy- a shiny white jeep
 Kyle rushed to pick it up and show it to his dad
 His dad thought the jeep was a great toy
 And Kyle had enough money to buy it
 The clerk took Kyle's money and placed the perfect car into a bag for the boy

A rabbit was hopping around following all the smells he could smell
 He had a great nose smelling carrots bushes flowers and other animals
 He smelled melons and he smelled a dish of ice cream
 Rabbits don't like ice cream so he moved to the flowers faster
 And he didn't really like to snack on melons either
 He saw friends the duckling and the mother duck but he was moving too fast to get to the flowers
 He could smell the flowers from a long way away
 He kept hopping to reach them faster and faster
 One hop two hops three hops
 On his third hop he always bounced a little higher
 He finally smelled the flowers close so he hopped a little bit faster
 The flowers were in sight
 He went up to them and smelled longer and harder than ever before
 A wonderful smell at last

How many hops until the rabbit bounced higher
What do rabbits not like
What did the rabbit smell
Did the rabbit have friends

     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten when Billy came to fetch her for her bath
  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her
  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out
   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game
   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George the parrot
  Finally since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap

A little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno
   What Billy didn't know was Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can her favorite game

   Billy sat down on the grass to wait
  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch

      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her
   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine
   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream
   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite

Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on
  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her
   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds
   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat
   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off
Once Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again
   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip Caramel Delight Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream

 Under the meat was a slice of dry toast
 Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza
 Even if it wasn't what he wanted the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains

  
Timmy was bored and wanted something to do but he didn't have any toys
 All he had was some paper his toothbrush and toothpaste
 He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train
 The house was quiet and nighttime was near
 He pretended he was camping
 It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain making scary shadows on the wall
  

He looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful
 If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures but he didn't even have a pencil
 

Timmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat
 He folded the paper into a mighty ship

Once upon a time there was a little white mouse that lived on a farm
 He liked to hide in the hay stacks where it was warm through the day and night
 On cold winter days he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn getting some extra warmth
 One winter day the mouse was very cold but needed something to eat
 He left the hay stack and ran past the lamp
 He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse didn't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm
 He ran and ran until he couldn't any longer
 The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside so the mouse was all alone
 He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred
 Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor
 The mouse waited until the farmer's wife Julie came out the back door and then the mouse ran into the kitchen
 There were bread crumbs everywhere
 The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him
 He heard the back door open again and hid under the oven
 It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking
 Farmer Bill liked pies more than bread cake or cookies
 The mouse stayed there to warm up then ran back to the barn to sleep for the night

Who opened the back door
What was baking in the oven
What did the mouse eat in the kitchen
What was the bug's name
The kids were playing outside
 They were drawing with chalk
 They drew many things with the chalk
 One of those things was a star
 There was nothing else for them to do because it was the weekend
 Then they stopped drawing with the chalk a little later
 They did not want to go on because they were tired
 They walked a little then started to splash by the lake that was nearby instead
 They thought it was a good idea because it was a hot day
 They played for hours
  They were making a lot of noise and laughing and talking
 They went home
 They did this because they were very tired
 They all ate some bread
 They were now quiet
 They couldn't have anything else to eat until their mother called them for dinner
 They waited and did not say a word
 They were resting
 Soon it would be time for the family meal

Why did they go home
Why did they splash by the lake
What did the kids draw
Why was there nothing for them to do
Once there was a fish who had lived his whole life in his bowl
 He often got bored and wished to see the rest of the world but because he was a fish he couldn't leave the water
 So one day he made a special fish suit that would allow him to walk on land and breathe air like humans
 He knew this would change his life and make him rich but first he would have to test it out


He put the suit on and leaped from the bowl that until now had been his whole world
 The suit worked
 Now he could go where he wanted


First he went to the kitchen of the house
 There he saw a parrot eating a cracker
 Second he went outside to the yard
 He saw squirrels there running around looking for food
 Third he went to the barn in the field
 He saw a mommy cow
 She was teaching her calf how to run

Finally he went to forest where he saw more trees than he had ever seen in his whole life


But after all this he was tired and made up his mind to go back to his home in the bowl
 It was a lot of work trying to see the world
 He took off the special suit and splashed back into the water
 His suit had passed the test and he was very happy but he had made up his mind that his bowl was the place for him

Who was eating a cracker in the kitchen
Where had the fish lived his whole life
Why did the fish return to his bowl
What did he see in the barn in the field
It was a beautiful day

 We woke up and watched some TV

Mommy gave us some money for candy later
 
Tommy and I went back to the park to play

Tommy and I played with a baseball with some other kids

Then we played with the football

We went to the store across the street

We bought some candy with the money Mommy gave us

We like swimming so we go swimming almost every day

We swam all afternoon until Mommy came down to the park at told us to come home

Mommy was worried that something might have happened to us

Mommy was not paying attention to her kids and what they were doing for hours
 
Tommy and I told Mommy she needs to pay more attention to us

Mommy started crying then Tommy and I started crying

Mommy said from now on I must pay more attention to you two
 
Daddy came home from work and playing softball for his company team

Daddy wanted to know what was going on

Ashley woke up bright and early on Friday morning during summer
  Her birthday was only a day away and her parents had promised her a trip to the fair as her present the next day
  She thought it was going to be quite a treat
  She skipped down the stairs to see her mom making a chocolate cake on the stove
  You run along outside to go play with your friends her mom told her I can get everything ready for your special lunch on my own
  
When Ashley made it outside she found her friend Katherine playing in the dirt
  When Ashley came closer she saw that in the dirt were a bunch of insects
  Katherine loved finding and collecting different ones for her insect collection
  Ashley thought it was kind of gross personally but she sat down next her anyways

Happy birthday Ashley Katherine yelled when she saw her best friend

I like to go to the park that is next to the hotel
 The park is very big and has lots of ladders and slides
 My favorite thing to do at the park is to swim in the lake
 The lake is small but there are a lot of red fish that live in it
 There are also some turtles and worms at the bottom of the lake
 Sometimes the fish swim by my leg and make me laugh and feel happy
 One time I stepped on a stick and cut my foot
 That cut hurt and made me sad
 The next time I went in the lake I was scared that I would get another cut
 Another thing I like to do at the park is to feed the animals
 There are lots of pigs squirrels and raccoon living in the park
 Sometimes I feed them bread and crackers
 Their favorite thing to eat is ham
 After I am done at the park I go to the store to buy some ice cream
 Sometimes I see my friend Christopher and he eats his ice cream with me
 Christopher also likes feeding the animals
 His favorite animal at the park is the squirrel

How do the fish make me feel
What animal lives in the lake

There once was a small boy who liked to wiggle
  He would wiggle everywhere he went
 He would wiggle during supper when he was eating his food
  He would wiggle down the winding path outside his house
 He could wiggle his right knee when he walked and that gave his wiggle even more wiggle


One day his grandpa was watching the boy wiggle
  His grandpa was old and liked to cough
  He had a long beard that was grey at the top
 He was tired of watching the boy wiggle and thought the boy was wiggling around a little too much
 So his grandpa gave the boy a pea and told him it was a magic pea
 He said the magic pea would stop his wiggle
 The boy started roaring with laughter
 He didn't believe a pea could stop his wiggle
  The grandpa put the pea in a little square bag and tied it around the boy's waist


The boy tried to wiggle but he couldn't wiggle at all
 All he could do was walk straight
 That was no fun
 What good was a boy if he couldn't wiggle when he wanted
  The grandpa coughed and smiled
 He enjoyed watching the boy not wiggle any more

Why did grandpa give the boy a pea
Where did grandpa put the pea
What happened when the boy got the pea

When I was a little girl I lived in a place with no winter
 It was always warm there
 It never got cold
 It never snowed
 Sometimes it rained
 Sometimes there was wind
 But there was no snow on the trees or on the ground
 There was no snow falling on our heads
 There was no snow to make a snowman
 

My teacher's name was Mrs
 Scott
 One day in December Mrs
 Scott told us that we were going to make a snowman
 We were excited
 We wanted to see a snowman
 We knew how a snowman looked
 We knew a snowman was made of three snowballs
 A snowman had to have a carrot nose and black eyes and buttons
 A snowman had a hat and a scarf
 We knew all these things
 

Mrs
 Scott asked us to bring everything we needed to our classroom to make a snowman
 Jimmy said I can bring the hat and the scarf
 Anita said I can bring a carrot for the nose
 Selma said I can cut out some black circles for the eyes and the buttons
 Ricky asked But who can bring the snow
 

Mrs
 Scott said I know what to do


The next day all the children brought the things for the snowman
 We did not know where Mrs
 Scott would get the snow
 Then she showed us
 Our snowman is made of three bushes
 Three bushes painted white
 We put all the things on the bushes and it looked like a real snowman

What did the children want to make
What happened in winter in the story
Who brought the hat and scarf
Who brought all the things to make the snowman

 He first went to talk to his brother but his brother was not home
 Then he went to talk to his dad but his dad was not home either
 Luckily the lion's sister was home
 He asked his sister why he thought he could not roar
 His sister said they need to go talk to their friend the squirrel
 The squirrel lived in a tree with a nice door mat outside
 The squirrel said to the lion if he wanted to start to roar instead of meow then he need to run faster than the other lion's
 So the next day the lion played a game in which he ran faster than all the other lions
 Now the lion roars and doesn't meow

Who did the lion first go talk to

Hello Dad I said
  My dad thought waking me up early for father-son time was a treat
  I wished we could hang out at night instead
 He sat in the chair at the foot of my bed with an enormously cheesy grin on his face with a big shopping bag on his lap


What's in the bag Dad


I bought you some presents
 You're a growing young man and it is only right that you pick a sport
 Dad dug through the bag and pulled out a football and a baseball
 Any of these look good


Dad you know all I want in life is to join the circus
 Why can't you let me be myself


Dad leaned in closer to me a serious look on his face
 Son when I was eight I wanted to join the circus too
 But when I got to high school everybody made fun of me
 They told me I was dumb for not playing sports and dumb for practicing juggling all day
 They told me that nobody would marry me if I didn't give up my circus dreams


Then how did you find Mom


By giving up my dreams of circus juggling and playing football instead
 Come on you'll like it


I slowly pulled myself out of bed and grabbed the football from Dad's hand
 I wanted to make him happy
 But I wish he could've been happy with a dream where you didn't get hit with things

What time is it
Why did the Dad play football in high school

This is why she was so large
 

One day when she was in the yard a group of street cats came up to her
 Oink oink they said in mean voices

 He kept asking me questions about this and then he asked me some questions about that and I was getting a little bit tired of all of the questions

 That no one even knew about
 No it wasn't about my golden guitar or even my goose that laid eggs filled with coins
 No he was asking me about my beans and their roots
 

You see I'm a giant and my job is to make sure the bean roots that we use to get down to earth are well protected and guarded
 They're what helps us get down to the little person world when we need to
 I became a little bit worried as the little kid asked more and more questions about my roots
 I didn't want to tell him that my roots were hidden in the library


I walked over to him to pick this little kid up to get him to quiet down about the bean roots well he got me with his little knife and I dropped him
 Thankfully he didn't get hurt or I would've been so sad

 I didn't follow him but I sure hope he doesn't come back for my stuff

 It came with a watering pot a shovel a rake and seeds
 The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden
 We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel put a seed or two in each hole and covered them up with dirt and raked over them
 Our dog was very confused because he's the one that digs the holes
 Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they'd gotten
 Every day they would get even bigger
 That was the most exciting part
 Then they started making little tomatoes and they sort of looked like grapes
 And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red
 This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner

what did he grow
who helped him pick the vegetables

There once was a wolf that liked to scare the other forest animals
 By daylight he pretended to be a kind nice wolf
 By night he would circle the forest and hunt down his food
 When he was very hungry he would find humans and woof like a dog in hopes that someone would feed him
 The wolf's favorite food was meat seasoned with lemon
 The wolf liked to watch his food run in circles like a hamster until he felt like eating it
 Sometimes the wolf would stay in the sand and lay in the sun until he would crawl back to his home and fall asleep with a full stomach
 On other days he goes home hungry
 Sometimes there would be a knock on his door and the wolf would be pleased because it meant his dinner had come to him and he would not have to hunt that day
 Those days were the best for the wolf by far

I couldn't believe today had come
 It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store
 First off let me say that my name is Lilly and as I'm sure you know today's my birthday
 Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties puppies lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me
 Some people dream of being a doctor or a nurse or even a teacher but I've always wanted to work with pets
 I'll say like many people I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them


I arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone
 Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha Margaret or Mary but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right
 Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals and I had so much fun the whole day
 I fed them gave them water and even got to play with them
 Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day
 It was everything I ever hoped and I can't wait for tomorrow

What has Lilly always wanted to do
Which of the following did Lilly not do with the animals
Which of the following is Lilly afraid of

 This scared us
 Bears can be dangerous

 This bear was a baby bear
 A leader told us that a bear with a baby can be much more dangerous
 We had to remember what to do when you come across a bear
 The leader told us not to walk towards the bear
 You also can not make any quick motions

 After a little bit of time we were away from the bears and we were safe

 One day the man spent more time in the wood and he became lost
 After days and days he grew hungry and weak
 When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him
 The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him making him get lost but he did


The wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him I can show you the way out of the woods if you give me the one thing you love most in the world


Since there was nothing that the man loved he said yes at once
 The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood
 The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time he too forgot about his promise
 

In time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved
 One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl making the man remember his promise

 And every time the girl said no the wizard would find a new way to make her sad
 But the girl had found a secret flower that was very beautiful


If you marry me I can let you out


There is a lovely bit of sunlight that comes in through the rocks
 I am very happy here in my cave
 The girl said
 The wizard became angry and steam poured from his eyes

He blocked out the sun so the girl lived only in darkness
 Still the girl said no
 The wizard came back again and told the girl If you marry me I can let you out
 The wizard became angry and steam poured from his mouth

There is a lovely stream of water that comes in through the rocks
 I am very happy here in my cave
 The girl said
 The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears

He blocked out the water so the girl lived only in dry sand
 Still the girl said no
 The wizard came back again and told the girl If you marry me I can let you out


Again the girl only said There is a soft wind that comes in through the rocks
 I am very happy here in my cave
 The wizard became angry and steam poured from his ears and fire came out of his eyes

So the Wizard blocked out the wind and left the girl in a hot cave with no air
 But the girl would still not marry him
 The wizard became so angry he turned to flame and burned up
 The girl was free and went down to her flower only to find it was gone
 Instead she found a handsome prince
 

I thank you my lady he said for saving me from the evil wizard
 In return you may come live in my palace with me and be happy

One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach
  We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it
 

We piled everyone into the car-my mom my dad my sister my dog and me
 I begged mom and dad to let me sit in the front seat but they said no
  I had to sit next to the smelly dog instead for the whole trip
 

When we got to the beach and opened the car door our dog raced down to the water to play
 I grabbed the large umbrella we brought and walked down to the sand with mom and dad
 After we had found a spot they let me go play in the water
 

It felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day
 As I swam around I saw many cool things like fish seaweed and shells
 I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in
 They would be great to add to my collection at home


When I got tired of swimming my sister and I wanted to make a sand castle
 We built towers using buckets and dug a huge ditch with our shovels
 When our castle was complete we were about to take a picture but then the dog ran it over and smashed it
 I was about to yell at the dog but then mom said it was getting late and we had to go home

  She remembered all of the words to her speech and she remembered to smile at the right times
  Her hard work and her lucky coin worked
  She won the free fireworks tickets

 Coffee was so proud of her that he turned her lucky coin into a necklace
  Angel wore it everywhere she went from then on
  The fireworks were pretty cool too

It was a cold day when John made up his mind to go outside and check the fence
  There had been things missing from the back yard and he was starting to think there was a criminal at work
  He put on his coat and started walking through the snow back to the long metal fence at the back of the yard
  It seemed like a lot longer walk than last summer when it was hot


Sure enough he found how the crook had gotten in
  A tree weighted down by the snow had fallen on the fence on a windy day and broken a section
  He got out his toolbox and with a tool cut some sections of wire
  He used the wires to fix the fence


Now it was time to catch the crook
  Sure enough he saw tracks heading to and from the fence
  But they weren't a crook's footprints
  It had been a raccoon that had been stealing things from his yard

I am going to get a hamster in a few weeks or maybe a month
 I have been waiting for a hamster for years so I don't want to wait another day
 She's going to have a big home with lots of paper towel rolls to eat or even sleep in
 My little hamster is going to bite me in the beginning as hamsters are nervous but we're going to end up being best friends
 She's going to sit on my shoulder as I do the dishes or do my homework
 When I'm reading my favorite book sleeping or when I'm showering my hamster needs to go back to her home
 I think that she is going to pee without warning and at the worst times I am going to scratch her little belly and love her all the more when she pushes carrots into her mouth
 I am sure that my little hamster is going to get into a lot more trouble too
 Maybe she'll be scared of thunder and try to run away
 Or maybe she'll be so curious about going outside to the street that she might get hurt
  I do not care about the amount of trouble that my little hamster gets into I'll always make sure she has water to drink food to eat and love from my heart

When am I going to get a hamster
What does my hamster need to be happy
When is my hamster sitting on my shoulder
What'll my hamster do that is bad

 It passed the birds it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds
 When it was there it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question

 It seemed strange to him but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring
 That still confused him
 

He thought he liked this dog not because of the color but because it was small
 And it was so hairy
 It was a like a mop that could run around
 He jumped on his favorite chair and looked down as Maggie ran under it
 She was kind of cute for a dog Pester thought to himself
 He layed down on the chair and pawed at her as she ran in a circle under it
 He tapped her ears as she went by and waved his tail like a flag trying to get her attention

 The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend slowly moving across the sky
 Finally the sun saw the moon and asked Pink moon
 What are you doing here
 Don't you know the sky is my home during the day
 Your time is coming soon enough
 Look I'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth


 But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun
 But great sun I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land can't see me
 Please let me join your light during the day this once
 By this time the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart
 The great sun said Though by day you disappear I always remember you are here
 Come to me now
 Stand in front of me and show the sand land your shine
 So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun
 At first covering part of the sun's circle then more then


a complete covering of the sun
 The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun
 All the lizards cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon
 But at that time the sun slipped away saying Farewell pink moon
 We have to do this again
 And so every few years the sun and moon come together to show the pink moon's is always with us even in the day time 

What color was the moon
What happened when the moon moved in front of the sun
Why was the pink moon lonely
How long did it take the moon to reach the sun

The angel alligator was quite the sight
  It loved to scream with all its might


It loved to roll in mud and sun
  Then it would go for a run


But why did it run
  Why did it scream
  

It had a fork in its butt
  

It sat in a trashcan
  This was not a smart thing to do
  But he did it oh yes oh me oh you


The alligator had a beard
  It was a great beard
  But nobody ever talked about his beard
  Why
  Because they would only see the fork in its butt


But one day the alligator made a friend

One morning I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast
 I fixed my normal breakfast hot pickles marshmallows and ketchup
 First I heat up the pickles on the stove then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup
 Delicious
 I eat it every morning often with a tall glass of lemonade


I sat down at the table to eat and looked out the window at the birds in my yard
 Sometimes I see skunks outside and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig
 But today there were only a few flamingos
 I opened up the book I was reading All About Birds
 I had finished the chapter on pigeons and was moving on to robins


While putting ketchup on my marshmallows I felt something tickling my neck
 I looked down and there was a daddy long-legs climbing up
 I had never seen one so close to my face
 

Er what's up
 I asked
 

Not much he said
 I smelled the hot pickles and wanted to have a taste


Sure little guy I said
 I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out
 While I was doing that that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm
 He grabbed the rest of my pickle and ran out the door
 And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast

What type of birds did I see in my yard
What did the sneaky spider do
What was tickling my neck
What do I heat up on the stove for breakfast

It was Tuesday
  Tuesday was Square's favorite day
  Wednesday was nice because it was always Spaghetti Night
  Saturday was great because of the morning cartoons
  But Tuesday
  Tuesday was the day it always went to visit its friend Diamond


It was a beautiful day
  The spring wind was blowing and the sun was shining
  Square and Diamond went to play by the river
  

They were having a great time
  They swam
  They fished
  They played hide and seek


Suddenly the wind picked up


Hey Square
  Would you like to see a trick


Sure Diamond
  What is it


Diamond took a string out of its pocket
  Diamond tied it to her and then she tied it to a tree


Watch this
  Diamond jumped into the wind
  Suddenly she was flying
  She floated
  She swooped
  She played with the clouds and the birds
  She flew faster
  She flew slower


At first Square was amazed
  But slowly Square started to frown


Diamond landed in front of her friend
  What's wrong


That was amazing
  It looks like a lot of fun
  But I am not shaped like a kite
  I can't do those amazing things like you


Diamond smiled
  Yes you can Square
  Stand on your tip-toes


So Square did


Now go look at yourself in the river


Square walked to the river and looked down
  But he did not see a square
  He saw a diamond


Diamond handed Square the string
  Now jump
 she said


Square jumped
  He jumped as high as he could
  Just as he started to fall the wind blew and picked him up


He was flying like Diamond


He floated
  He swooped
  He played with the clouds and the birds
  He flew faster
  He flew slower


He soon landed
  The sun was setting so they said goodbye and made plans to meet again next Tuesday


It was a beautiful day

What did Square see in the river
Why was Square sad
What did Square and Diamond do
What is Square's favorite day
The sun was rising in the morning and the birds were waking up
 A mother bird was watching over her baby eggs in the nest
 She laid four eggs yesterday some white and some spotted
 She had been keeping them warm so that her babies would soon be born
 Little cracks appeared on the eggs and they started to grow and grow
 Little cheeping sounds could be heard coming from inside and soon the eggs cracked open
 Featherless baby birds were inside crying for food
 The mother had nothing to give so she quickly flew to the ground and looked in the dirt for food
 She saw some worms wiggling in the ground
 She picked a few up with her beak and flew them up to the nest
 The babies were well fed with the worms and the mother kept them all warm in the cold spring morning
 Mr
 Bird came home to find his new babies and they were all a happy family

What color are the eggs

Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles
 He was black and white and had long floppy ears
 He also had very short legs but really big paws
 Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game
 Toodles loved playing fetch
 One Saturday Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there
 He ran all around the pond barking at the ducks
 The ducks ignored him and kept swimming
 Toodles wasn't having it
 He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks chasing around his new playmates
 One of the ducks braver than the others poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears
 Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear
 Soaking wet he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better
 After that whenever he would see a duck Toodles would run the other way

Why did we go to the park every Saturday
What did Toodles look like
Why was Toodles soaking wet
Why did Toodles curl up in my lap
I don't think I can win the race Tim told his parents over breakfast
 His mother asked Why not
 but his father was silent
 Tim knew his father didn't believe he could be a racer only last year he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son wasn't a better runner
 The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be and maybe he didn't like to run
 

Tim who had always preferred a good book to P
E
 class wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school's Spring Fun Run
 

Tim answered I'm going to try to win but Angela is so quick
 No one ever beats her at recess
 

Well we'll be there for you either way his mother said


Tim took an apple and walked to the bus
 Since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 300 today instead of 315) he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began
 He didn't even bring his new book with him an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be


330 arrived and the race was about to begin
 All the other students had brought running shorts but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants
 Suddenly he saw that his shoes were untied
 As he bent down to tie them one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee making him fall down right as the race began
 By the time he got up and tied his shoes he saw he would finish in last place as the other kids were much farther ahead of him
 

It was almost 400 before Tim saw the end of the run
 By the time Tim reached the finish line the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small as some kids had been finished for a long time
 Tim's father asked What took you so long
 I'm surprised to see you here at all
 Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you wouldn't win
 

Tim thought about why he signed up
 It wasn't about winning the race or making his father proud
 It was about finishing and showing himself that the doctor was right he could be anything he wanted to be like his favorite character Simon

Why does Tim start out so far behind
What time does the race start
Why does Tim run the race
What does Tim bring to school

Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends
 Lions have big teeth sharp claws and sometimes they are very cranky
 They don't always get along with other animals or humans so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends
 Zebras and lions like to play tag but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt

The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song to tell all the other animals to sing along
 The dog barked the other birds sang the squirrel squeaked and the rabbit clapped its ears together
 The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard
 He thought to himself that he wouldn't have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it
 He tried to look for water but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he couldn't smell anything
 Not even water
 

Luckily for the cat cats have very good eyes and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye
 He ran to it
 He wondered why the water was kind of yellow and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle
 The cat took a big drink
 It made his tongue felt so much better that it made him want to sing but the others were done and the bird had flown away

 Today's the day that we're going to the candy store and picking out a new treat to have after dinner
 Some people may like going to the movies or the game room or even to parks but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity
 As soon as we pull up she tells me to not run around too much inside but I'm so excited I barely hear her
 She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us
 Since we do this each week he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he's come up with a few candies for me to try
 

I walk over to the table and see three types of M&M's laid out
 He knows I'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind instead giving me mint flavored cookies 'n creme flavored and white chocolate flavored
 They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most
 It takes me a bit to choose but I finally choose the Mint as this week's choice
 He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much he's going to give us a sale so we think it'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off
 Actually the clerk ends up cutting it half off
 We thanked him and went on our way as I tried not to eat all the way home

 Joey and Jimmy played silly games together and were always laughing
 One day Joey and Jimmy went swimming together at their Aunt Julie's pond
 Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left
 He couldn't find anything to eat except for pie
 Usually Joey would eat cereal fruit (a pear) or oatmeal for breakfast

I'll need some popcorn a pea some melon balls and a cup of yogurt
 I'm going to make a very special cake today she said


Wow that sounds horrible said John


Yeah we'd rather watch TV and eat potato chips said Sally


Don't talk back kids
 Do what I said and head into town
 It's a beautiful day
 Go the long way and follow the river until you get there
 Don't take the short way through the forest
 A lion has escaped from the zoo
 He might be hiding in the forest


So John and Sally started the walk into town but because they were disobedient children they didn't follow the river like their mother told them
 Instead they took the short way through the forest


I'm not afraid of a lion in the forest said John
 Besides I think mom has been eating too many melon balls and is letting her imagination get away from her again
 If there were a lion in the forest we would know about it


So they wandered along the forest path jumping in mud puddles and throwing sticks at one another
 But as soon as John and Sally were in the darkest part of the forest they heard a terrible roar
 It was the lion
 Horrified they ran for their lives out of the forest all the way back home


We're sorry

 We'll never be disobedient again

 Not only that but the sound of a high pitched voice announcing It's here
 It's here Janet it's here
 That voice belonged to my sister Karen
 What she meant was that the day had finally come for our family trip to the nearby beach located beyond Eagle Point
 She got our parents out of bed way before they were ready to be up but they knew how much it meant to her so they put a smile on as mother made breakfast and father packed the family car with towels and umbrellas
 We could barely hear him say how there wasn't much room for many items but he fit it all together like every year
 I warned him last go around to get something larger like a truck or a van even joking an airplane but he stuck to his guns and stayed with cars


Truthfully I had forgotten about the trip and made plans with my friends Lauren and Matthew
 As sad as I was to have to back out I called the two of them and let them know of my mistake
 They understood and soon after we all entered the car and went on our way to the beach

It was Friday morning and Bob and Shelly were in the park waiting for Lucy
 She was late and when she finally showed up she had forgotten the ball
 

What can we use for a ball
 Bob asked
 
They looked around
 There were rocks but they were too hard
 There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat
 Finally Bob being the tallest saw that in a pile of plants that there were melons growing
 
Let's use a melon Bob said

That's stupid said Shelly the practical one

No hear him out said Lucy
 It might work

It'll work said Bob and he picked a melon and handed it to Shelly
 You pitch

This is going to end badly I'm afraid Shelly said throwing the melon at Bob who stood over home plate

I know what I'm doing Bob said swinging the bat as hard as he could
 When the bat hit the melon it splatted into a million pieces raining sticky pieces down on Bob and Shelly and Lucy and a wedding party that had been setting up nearby
 
Oops said Bob

I was really scared walking into school today
 It was the first day of sixth grade and I was excited to be leaving elementary school but I ended up going to a different middle school than all my friends since I moved across town last year
 My name is Matt but I'm going to try and not let anyone else know that as I'd rather sit in the back and keep to myself
 I didn't want to ride the bus so my mom said she would drive me there for today
 Thankfully I found my classroom but I walked in and saw nobody I knew as I thought
 I took a seat at an empty table as the teacher Mrs
 Frank took roll call
 She seemed nice and I'm happy we weren't told to sit in alphabetical order or by boys to boys and girls to girls as I was free to sit by myself for now
 Mrs
 Frank called out Jimmy Sally Linda Jason and then finally got to my name in which I raised my hand quickly
 As soon as she was done a few of the kids who arrived late came to sit by me and said their names were Martin and Mark


Martin said he liked how our names all sounded the same and Mark seconded that as we started talking before class began
 When it was time to eat we all said we would sit with one another in the lunch room and also when it came to recess and playing together
 It was nice to have some friends after being so nervous earlier and see that everything does work out in the end
 Hopefully soon we can all play together outside of class but as far as today it was a great start

A man sailed out to sea in a small boat
 The sun was only rising but this man liked spending all day fishing
 A long way away from the shore he stopped his boat
 He pulled out his fishing pole and put some worms on the hook
 He held it in the deep water and waited for a long time
 After three hours there was still not a bite
 The sun moved slowly across the sky
 Morning turned into afternoon and afternoon to evening
 It was a slow day of fishing and he had to pack up
 A fisherman does not give up so easy even after many hours
 It takes time to catch fish and fishing is not for people who give up quickly

 He went home to his log cabin and sat by the fire
 His stomach growled because there wasn't any dinner to eat tonight but tomorrow would be a better day

Curtis liked to feed the horses chickens pigs dogs and the cat
 He also like to help take care of them when they got hurt or sick
 Once Curtis stayed in the barn all night helping his father with a sick pony
 The animal doctor was there too and Curtis watched everything that he did

 And he kept checking her eyes and mouth


When the pony got better the animal doctor went home
 But Curtis and his father stayed in the barn with the pony until it became light outside
 Curtis had gone to sleep so his father carried him to their house and put him to bed


Curtis was so tired that even the smell of bacon from the kitchen didn't wake him up
 Later his father came and woke him
 Bonnie is going to be alright he said to Curtis


Really
 the boy said as he rubbed his eyes I got to go check on her
 

That can wait
 Right now you need to eat something
 I saved you some bacon Mr
 sleepy head his father said as he smiled at Curtis


Curtis washed dressed and ate as fast as he could and then raced to the barn
 He stood on a stool and looked into Bonnie's eyes and mouth
 He put his head on her chest and listened to her heart
 Then he checked her legs and tail
 He tried to do everything the animal doctor did and more


Curtis saw his father standing at the door and said Everything looks okay daddy
 I think she can go out to the big tree with the other horses


Okay Dr

 Let's take her outside

There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole
 His name was Isaac
 He worked at Santa's factory baking cakes with lots of frosting
 He didn't like making cake much
 In fact Isaac's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys
 But since he was a frog he was never allowed to build toys with the elves
 One day he got a smart idea
 He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory hoping no one would find out
 So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on
 He put on the elf hat the elf shirt and the elf shoes
 He really looked like an elf
 So one day when the factory was opening for the morning Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory
 Luckily it worked and no one found out
 Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before
 It was huge and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas
 He joined them in building and for a long time no one knew he was a frog
 That is until one elf named Joe saw that there was something weird about Isaac
 He didn't look like the rest of the elves
 So he kept his eye on Isaac waiting to see what his secret was

Millie thought she would like to stop eating meat but she didn't know if she could do it
  Once when she was younger she had tried to go without eating meat but before the first day was over her stomach had felt a little empty
  Hmm she had thought
  Maybe it's not good for me to stop eating meat
  Maybe that's why I feel so hungry


But now she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn't feel so hungry even if she did stop eating meat


She went to the library and there she saw a magazine
  Below the title the cover said Learn to live on vegetables
  She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly
  If she really felt hungry for a little meat the magazine said it was okay to have some and then go back to eating her veggies


She also read that beans could give her body a lot of the same things meat could but that eating things like rice and noodles would help the beans do a better job of building her body and giving it energy
  That way she would feel better instead of feeling so hungry


Millie wasn't sure if it would work this time but the magazine's tips made her want to give it another try

What did she read about in the magazine
Why did Millie think she felt hungry
What did Millie think after reading the magazine
What did Millie find at the library

I once was the leader of running a skills camp for a Boy Scout group
 The weekend long camp included a lot of different games
 One of the games was for fire-building
 The point of the game was to help teach campers how to best build fires
 There are many different ways you can build a campfire
 You can build a lean-to campfire
 You can also build a teepee fire
 To build the fires you must find and sort different sizes of sticks and brush and larger logs to get the fire going
 The goal of the game is to build a fire big enough to burn a string that is hanging a few feet above the ground
 My group was falling behind so I gave the idea of throwing a bunch of leaves on the fire all at once to make a huge fire to quickly burn the string
 We were not allowed to win the game because it was said we cheated

Did the group win the game
Who was the camp for
How did you win the fire making game

A little mouse lived in a little house
  The mouse would hurry along the walls at night looking for food
  Sometimes he'd find frosting from a cake
  Those were good days
  Sometimes he'd find paint from a paint can
  Those were bad days
  Either way he'd always get scared whenever the phone rang
  It was so loud and made him jump
  Yesterday he tripped over a wire because he wasn't looking where he was going
 The television was on full volume so no one saw it
  He loved running around in the kitchen
  There was always leftover food on a spoon in the sink
  Sometimes it was dried food and he'd have to scrape it off with his claws
  It still tasted good to the mouse
  He was so happy there were no other animals living around there
  He had heard a piggy ate a lot more than a mouse
  He didn't want to have to fight a piggy over food
  Life was really good for this little mouse

What did the mouse look for at night
What was something the mouse found on a good day
What did the mouse trip over when phone rang
What was something the mouse found on a bad day
